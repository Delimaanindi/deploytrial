        <h2>Hi!</h2>
        <p id="bla">My journey to programming world started when i was an Astronomy student at Institut Teknologi Bandung (ITB). 
            I coded using Fortran to analyze raw data and python to visualize my data for my thesis. 
            At that time i had no interest nor plan to be a programmer. 
            However, when i got a job at a company who offered me to be their programmer, 
            i started to try and learned basic coding using Clojure. I really enjoy learning programming languages and code as a job. 
            Therefore, i decided to dive deeper into programming world and found out the role as Frontend Engineer. 
            I enrolled myself in Frontend Engineer Bootcamp held by Binar Academy and graduated in December 2022. 
            The programming languages that i learned during bootcamp were ReactJs, HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap and vanilla Javascript. 
            Final Project of the bootcamp was a car rental website which the link is provided in the homepage. 
            Besides, i also created a comic reading website using ReactJS, while a simple calculator and 
            temperature converter was coded with vanilla Javascript, HTML5, and CSS.
